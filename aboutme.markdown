Hello and welcome to my blog! My name is Artis Lismanis and I’m a data professional based in London, United Kingdom. I currently work as Head of Data Development at [Cox Automotive UK](https://www.coxauto.co.uk/) and I’m passionate about combining data and technology with agile and lean principles to make data ‘easy’ and more accessible to the end-user.

This blog is an attempt to capture my thoughts on various data topics together with any useful information I come across in my daily work as well as tinkering with technology outside work. It is still very early days but you can expect to read my musings on data processing, visualisation, managing high performing teams and value of data at a more strategic level. There will be plenty of practical how-to articles, an odd book review as well as some odd bits and bobs I park here for my reference. My current hot topics, in no particular order, include Databricks, Apache Spark, Scala, Tableau as a platform, practical data management, driving data literacy, defining and implementing data strategy... 

I'm keen to connect with people passionate about the value of data. Please engage by commenting on articles, agreeing or disagreeing and sharing your own experience. Any feedback on how this blog could be improved would be massively appreciated. And if you have made this far, don't be a stranger, reach out and say hello on social networks via links at the bottom of this blog.
